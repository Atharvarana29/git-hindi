this is the readme file . it is always recommended to add this in the folder. like index.html is designed
similarly
git is designed in such a way that when you make a readme.md file then everything will get automatically pushed to it.
it is a markdown file


here also the procedure will be same write (just the difference here is that : here we do not write the code , just the description of our code) , add, commit
 
 then as usual you have to push this to git hub by git push 

 here you can also match the git commit id if you wish  by git --oneline
 then refresh the github page and you can see it there and then only anybody can fork it and do all the stuffs
